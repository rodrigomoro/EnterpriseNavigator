I want you to extend the person fields. I got these from Microsoft Entra ID as reference:

Property Type Description assistantName String The name of the contact's assistant. birthday DateTimeOffset The contact's birthday. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z businessAddress PhysicalAddress The contact's business address. businessHomePage String The business home page of the contact. businessPhones String collection The contact's business phone numbers. categories String collection The categories associated with the contact. changeKey String Identifies the version of the contact. Every time the contact is changed, ChangeKey changes as well. This allows Exchange to apply changes to the correct version of the object. children String collection The names of the contact's children. companyName String The name of the contact's company. createdDateTime DateTimeOffset The time the contact was created. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z department String The contact's department. displayName String The contact's display name. You can specify the display name in a create or update operation. Note that later updates to other properties may cause an automatically generated value to overwrite the displayName value you have specified. To preserve a pre-existing value, always include it as displayName in an update operation. emailAddresses EmailAddress collection The contact's email addresses. fileAs String The name the contact is filed under. generation String The contact's suffix. givenName String The contact's given name. homeAddress PhysicalAddress The contact's home address. homePhones String collection The contact's home phone numbers. id String The contact's unique identifier. By default, this value changes when the item is moved from one container (such as a folder or calendar) to another. To change this behavior, use the Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId" header. See Get immutable identifiers for Outlook resources for more information. Read-only. imAddresses String collection The contact's instant messaging (IM) addresses. initials String The contact's initials. jobTitle String The contactâ€™s job title. lastModifiedDateTime DateTimeOffset The time the contact was modified.
